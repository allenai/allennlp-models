## About

This repository contains the components - such as [`DatasetReader`](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/data/dataset_readers/dataset_reader/#datasetreader), [`Model`](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/models/model/#model), and [`Predictor`](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/predictors/predictor/#predictor) classes - for applying [AllenNLP](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp) to a wide variety of NLP [tasks](#tasks-and-components).
It also provides an easy way to download and use [pre-trained models](#pre-trained-models) that were trained with these components.

### Tasks and components

This is an overview of the tasks supported by the AllenNLP Models library along with the corresponding components provided, organized by category. For a more comprehensive overview, see the [AllenNLP Models documentation](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/) or the [Paperswithcode page](https://paperswithcode.com/lib/allennlp).

- [**Classification**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/classification)
  
    Classification tasks involve predicting one or more labels from a predefined set to assign to each input. Examples include Sentiment Analysis, where the labels might be `{"positive", "negative", "neutral"}`, and Binary Question Answering, where the labels are `{True, False}`.

    üõ† **Components provided:** Dataset readers for various datasets, including [BoolQ](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/classification/dataset_readers/boolq/) and [SST](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/classification/dataset_readers/stanford_sentiment_tree_bank/), as well as a [Biattentive Classification Network](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/classification/models/biattentive_classification_network/) model.

- [**Coreference Resolution**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/coref)

    Coreference resolution tasks require finding all of the expressions in a text that refer to common entities.

    <div align="center">
    <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/coref.shtml"><img src="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/corefexample.png" width="300" /></a>

- [**Multiple Choice**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/mc)

    Multiple choice tasks require selecting a correct choice among alternatives, where the set of choices may be different for each input. This differs from classification where the set of choices is predefined and fixed across all inputs.

    üõ† **Components provided:** A [transformer-based multiple choice model](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/mc/models/transformer_mc/) and a handful of dataset readers for specific datasets.

- [**Pair Classification**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/pair_classification)

    Pair classification is another broad category that contains tasks such as Textual Entailment, which is to determine whether, for a pair of sentences, the facts in the first sentence imply the facts in the second.

    üõ† **Components provided:** Dataset readers for several datasets, including [SNLI](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/pair_classification/dataset_readers/snli/) and [Quora Paraphrase](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/pair_classification/dataset_readers/quora_paraphrase/).

- [**Reading Comprehension**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/rc)

    Reading comprehension tasks involve answering questions about a passage of text to show that the system understands the passage.

    üõ† **Components provided:** Models such as [BiDAF](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/rc/models/bidaf/) and a [transformer-based QA model](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/rc/models/transformer_qa/), as well as readers for datasets such as [DROP](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/rc/dataset_readers/drop/), [QuAC](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/rc/dataset_readers/quac/), and [SQuAD](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/rc/dataset_readers/squad/).

- [**Structured Prediction**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/structured_prediction)

    Structured prediction includes tasks such as Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), which is for determining the latent predicate argument structure of a sentence and providing representations that can answer basic questions about sentence meaning, including who did what to whom, etc.

    üõ† **Components provided:** Dataset readers for [Penn Tree Bank](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/structured_prediction/dataset_readers/penn_tree_bank/), [OntoNotes](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/structured_prediction/dataset_readers/srl/), etc., and several models including one for [SRL](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/structured_prediction/models/srl/) and a very general [graph parser](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/structured_prediction/models/graph_parser/).

- [**Text + Vision**](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/vision)

    This is a catch-all category for any text + vision multi-modal tasks such Visual Question Answering (VQA), the task of generating a answer in response to a natural language question about the contents of an image.

    üõ† **Components provided:** Several models such as a [ViLBERT model for VQA](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/vision/models/vilbert_vqa/) and one for [Visual Entailment](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/vision/models/visual_entailment/), along with corresponding dataset readers. 

### Pre-trained models

Every pretrained model in AllenNLP Models has a corresponding [`ModelCard`](https://docs.allennlp.org/main/api/common/model_card/#modelcard) in the [`allennlp_models/modelcards/`](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/tree/main/allennlp_models/modelcards) folder.
Many of these models are also hosted on the [AllenNLP Demo](https://demo.allennlp.org) and the [AllenNLP Project Gallery](https://gallery.allennlp.org/).

To programmatically list the available models, you can run the following from a Python session:

```python
>>> from allennlp_models import pretrained
>>> print(pretrained.get_pretrained_models())
```

The output is a dictionary that maps the model IDs to their `ModelCard`:

```
{'structured-prediction-srl-bert': <allennlp.common.model_card.ModelCard object at 0x14a705a30>, ...}
```

You can load a `Predictor` for any of these models with the [`pretrained.load_predictor()`](https://docs.allennlp.org/models/main/models/pretrained/#load_predictor) helper.
For example:

```python
>>> pretrained.load_predictor("mc-roberta-swag")
```

Here is a list of pre-trained models currently available.

## Installing

### From PyPI

`allennlp-models` is available on PyPI. To install with `pip`, just run

```bash
pip install allennlp-models
```

Note that the `allennlp-models` package is tied to the [`allennlp` core package](https://pypi.org/projects/allennlp-models). Therefore when you install the models package you will get the corresponding version of `allennlp` (if you haven't already installed `allennlp`). For example,

```bash
pip install allennlp-models==2.2.0
pip freeze | grep allennlp
# > allennlp==2.2.0
# > allennlp-models==2.2.0
```

### From source

If you intend to install the models package from source, then you probably also want to [install `allennlp` from source](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp#installing-from-source).
Once you have `allennlp` installed, run the following within the same Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models.git
cd allennlp-models
ALLENNLP_VERSION_OVERRIDE='allennlp' pip install -e .
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

The `ALLENNLP_VERSION_OVERRIDE` environment variable ensures that the `allennlp` dependency is unpinned so that your local install of `allennlp` will be sufficient. If, however, you haven't installed `allennlp` yet and don't want to manage a local install, just omit this environment variable and `allennlp` will be installed from the main branch on GitHub.

Both `allennlp` and `allennlp-models` are developed and tested side-by-side, so they should be kept up-to-date with each other. If you look at the GitHub Actions [workflow for `allennlp-models`](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp-models/actions), it's always tested against the main branch of `allennlp`. Similarly, `allennlp` is always tested against the main branch of `allennlp-models`.

### Using Docker

Docker provides a virtual machine with everything set up to run AllenNLP--
whether you will leverage a GPU or just run on a CPU.  Docker provides more
isolation and consistency, and also makes it easy to distribute your
environment to a compute cluster.

Once you have [installed Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) you can either use a [prebuilt image from a release](https://hub.docker.com/r/allennlp/models) or build an image locally with any version of `allennlp` and `allennlp-models`.

If you have GPUs available, you also need to install the [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) runtime.

To build an image locally from a specific release, run

```bash
docker build \
    --build-arg RELEASE=1.2.2 \
    --build-arg CUDA=10.2 \
    -t allennlp/models - < Dockerfile.release
```

Just replace the `RELEASE` and `CUDA` build args with what you need. You can check [the available tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/allennlp/allennlp/tags)
on Docker Hub to see which CUDA versions are available for a given `RELEASE`.

Alternatively, you can build against specific commits of `allennlp` and `allennlp-models` with

```bash
docker build \
    --build-arg ALLENNLP_COMMIT=d823a2591e94912a6315e429d0fe0ee2efb4b3ee \
    --build-arg ALLENNLP_MODELS_COMMIT=01bc777e0d89387f03037d398cd967390716daf1 \
    --build-arg CUDA=10.2 \
    -t allennlp/models - < Dockerfile.commit
```

Just change the `ALLENNLP_COMMIT` / `ALLENNLP_MODELS_COMMIT` and `CUDA` build args to the desired commit SHAs and CUDA versions, respectively.

Once you've built your image, you can run it like this:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.allennlp/
docker run --rm --gpus all -v $HOME/.allennlp:/root/.allennlp allennlp/models
```

> Note: the `--gpus all` is only valid if you've installed the nvidia-docker runtime.
