                    The worlds of fiction and myth are full of wheeled creatures, so why not the real world? After
                    all, the wheel is an efficient design, and it seems like there would be obvious advantages to
                    quickly moving around while consuming little energy.
                    The key is to remember that evolution is a process, not something that happens overnight. A
                    giraffe with just a little bit longer neck than the others will be able to reach slightly
                    higher trees, which will ultimately lead to the species' neck length getting longer and longer
                    over generations. In the meantime, those other giraffes can still eat, just not quite as well.
                    But a wheel either works or it doesn't. A somewhat circular semi-wheelish thing would only be a
                    hindrance, and evolution can't produce a trait that's perfect from the get-go.
