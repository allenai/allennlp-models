    "description": "Textual Entailment (TE) is the task of predicting whether, for a pair of sentences, the facts in the first sentence necessarily imply the facts in the second.",
    "expected_inputs": "The task expects a `premise` sentence and a `hypothesis` sentence.",
    "expected_outputs": "The expected output is whether the `premise` entails/contradicts/is neutral towards the `hypothesis`.",
    "scope_and_limitations": "This task is in some sense \"NLP-complete\", and you should not expect any current model to cover every possible aspect of entailment. Instead, you should think about what the model was trained on to see whether it could reasonably capture the phenomena that you are querying it with.",
