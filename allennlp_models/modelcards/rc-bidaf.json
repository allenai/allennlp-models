        "description": "This is an implementation of the BiDAF model with GloVe embeddings. The basic layout is pretty simple:
                        encode words as a combination of word embeddings and a character-level encoder, pass the
                        word representations through a bi-LSTM/GRU, use a matrix of
                        attentions to put question information into the passage word representations (this is the only
                        part that is at all non-standard), pass this through another few layers of bi-LSTMs/GRUs, and
                        do a softmax over span start and span end.",
