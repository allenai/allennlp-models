        "description": "The basic outline of this model is to get an embedded representation of each span in the document. These span representations are scored  and used to prune away spans that are unlikely to occur in a coreference  cluster. For the remaining spans, the model decides which antecedent span (if any) they are coreferent with. The resulting coreference links, after applying transitivity, imply a clustering of the spans in the document. The GloVe embeddings in the original paper have been substituted with SpanBERT embeddings.",
