        "description": "The basic outline of this model is to get an embedded representation
                        of each span in the document. These span representations are scored 
                        and used to prune away spans that are unlikely to occur in a coreference 
                        cluster. For the remaining spans, the model decides which antecedent
                        span (if any) they are coreferent with. The resulting coreference links, after applying
                        transitivity, imply a clustering of the spans in the document.
                        The GloVe embeddings in the original paper have been substituted with SpanBERT embeddings.",
